the pacman wrapper that makes this distrobution possible is defined here
it consists of a series of modules that work togeather as follows:
    Hopper provides infornmation to complete PKGBUILD.in files
    Updater
    Storage stores the completed PKGBUILD and retrieves it on the client machine
    Builder builds the package for local use
all parts are modular, these modules are available as of now:
    Hopper:
        feed: provides jobs through a series of modules that querry sources
            they are arranged in a queue that arranges them by time of next querry
            when an update is found, the infornmation is sent to the updater
    Updater:
        provides a module that puts the data from the updater into a 
        PKGBUILD.in and moves it to the storage module, it also privides
        an interface for forcing an update due to an updated PKGBUILD.in
    Storage:
        a storage method for retrieving and sending PKGBUILD files generated
        by the Updater.  This will probably be a network filesystem implementation
    Builder:
        builds a PKGBUILD for the local system.  can be automatic or manual
