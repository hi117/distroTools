the updater is the main control process of the system.
it uses a pipe to get infornmation from hoppers.
the updater runs the hopper module as a seperate process
the hopper sends the package,version pairs to the updater where it compares
it to a databse of latest versions, if the version is newer, then it generates a new PKGBUILD
and sends it to the storage.
